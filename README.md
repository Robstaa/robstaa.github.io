# Wiredelta excercise

## Planning for layout of the website
- Asking the user for their birthdate
- Giving out the possible age(s)
- Asking the user about their favorite snack
- Asking the user: "How much of your SNACK do you eat in a day on average"
- Giving out how much they would need until the max age

## TODO

- Refactor to ES6 Standard
- Make JS DRY, to not have same or similar strings and calculations twice
